                  <p><p>Hey! My name is Taylor Anderson and I'm an aspiring Interaction
Designer. I'm currently a student at Indiana University - Bloomington,
studying Informatics with a Human-Centered Computing cognate.
<br><br>
My design thinking and philosophy is very much influenced by my
personality traits as well as my life experiences. I like to think I am 
creative and unique but also practical and logical. And I believe those 
traits are represented in my designs. I always try to come up with 
innovative designs while also trying to keep them as simple and user-
friendly as possible. Creative and out-of-the-box designs are great as 
long as users can actually use them. There needs to be some balance. 
<br><br>
To me, a successful design is one that helps make someone’s life just a 
little better. Even if it’s as small as making an everday activity more     enjoyable or pleasant - at least it’s making some sort of impact on         someone.
<br><br>
Other than IxD stuff, I love to cook/eat food (well...mostly eat, let's     be real), snowboard, and workout.

<p>"MyFridgeRecipes" is a mobile application that helps home cooks, especially those who don’t know a lot about cooking, find recipes according to what ingredients they have on hand.</p>

<h5>Beginning Stages</h5>
<p>When I first came up with the idea for this application, there were alot of features I wanted to include. Not only did I want the app to find recipes by ingredient, but also by type of meal (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner) or allergies/dietary restrictions (No nuts, Low-Carb, Vegetarian). If the user has an is allergic to nut, for example, they could choose to only see recipes that do not have nuts. And, to make the process as simple as possible, I also wanted the app to remember that the user has a nut allergy so they don’t have to input it every time. However, if the user was just cooking for someone who has a nut allergy (meaning they won’t be cooking like that all the time), they could choose to just temporary filter out the recipes with nuts. 
</p>
<p>Once I had an idea of what features I wanted to implement, I started sketching. Originally, I wanted the ingredient to appear in a removeable box underneath the search so that the user could a) easily see what things they have inputed and b) to make it easy for them to remove them.</p>

<h5>Coding</h5>
<p>After the planning stage of the project, I jumped into the code. Before this, I had bascially no Android Development skills. I learned a little Java back in the day but that was about it. So, once I started coding, I realized I may have taken on a little more than I could chew. I had no idea how I was actually going to implement the features I wanted to include in my app. So, I started researching. A lot. Most of my time was spent learning and practicing how to implement certain features and components in Android Studio. Because of how much trouble I was having with it all, I had to change my original design slightly. So, I had to scratch the "ingredient box" idea. I just could not find a way to make it work.
</p>
<h5>User Testing</h5>
<p>
Once my app had its main functions and looked decent enough to show to other people, I did a little user testing. My user was able to point out some bugs for me as well as add some input about what she thought about the app. Overall, she thought it was a cool idea. One of the things she thought would improve it was to somehow intergrate it with social media. Such as, sharing images of recipes you made on Instagram or sharing a recipe on Facebook. As cool as those ideas were, I unfortunatly was unable to include them in the final version of the app because of time contraints.
</p>
<h5>Final Version</h5>
<p>After hours of no sleep and staring at my computer screen, I was able to develop an app that was pretty close to the one I had originally designed. In the final version, along with being able to find recipes by ingredient, the user could also filter the results by type of meal or allergies/dietary restrictions. As the user inputs ingredients, meal types or allergy/dietary restrictions their recipe results will show up below. When the user taps on a recipe, they will be taken to the recipe page where they can see a brief description of the dish, the steps to prepare it and the nutritional information. The user can also adjust the recipe depending on how many people they are cooking for. The app keeps track of the recipes that user looks at, just in cause they want to quickly go back to a past recipe. If a user knows of a recipe that is not already in the database, they will have the ability to add it. </p>
<h5>Thoughts</h5>
<p>This was by far the hardest project I have worked on so far. I had to learn a lot about Android Development in a very short amount of time so that was a little hard for me to deal with. In the end, I am very proud (and somwhat surprised) that I was able to develop this. One thing I learned: Android is hard!</p>

<h4>Project Description</h4>
<p>In my HCI/d class, we designed a tablet application that could be used to help college students, mainly incoming freshman, pick a major based on a set of carefully selected questions, which depend on the college or university.
<br><br>
<i>We designed our concept following a modified version of the PRInCiPleS design framework, an organizing framework used in the HCI/d program at IU.</i></p>

<h5>Predispositions</h5>
<p>Most students don't really know what they want to do or be in the future when they enter college, which makes it difficult to choose a major.</p>

<h5>Research</h5>
<p>Since my team and I had all been freshman at some point, we all experienced the struggle of choosing a major during our freshman/sophomore years. But, we also wanted to get an oppinon from a student who was currently a freshman at the time. So, we interviewed a 1st year student who agreed that figuring out what he wanted to major was a difficult task when he first entered college. It also made it hard to choose classes for his first semester since he didn't really know what he wanted to do. Now, after taking a few classes, he had a better idea of what he liked and disliked which would make it easier for him to narrow down his options when deciding on a major. But, he felt like it would be much easier and less stressful if there was somehow a way to help him decide on a major before he enrolled in any classes.</p>

<h5>Insights</h5>
<p>How could we make the process of choosing a major easier and less stressful,  especially for 1st year students?</p>

<h5>Concept</h5>
<p>For our solution, we designed an experience that could change the way incoming freshman or any college student choose a major. The way the application worked was as follows: the student answers a set of carefully selected questions then, based on their results, the application will provide the student with a major/degree that fit them as best as possible. Along with the student's matched major, the application will also provide descriptions on courses that required for the major as well as sample schdeules and interviews from students who have majored in the student's matched major. Although, we didn't include it in our design, we also thought that the application should also provide successful alumni who earned degrees in that field to get a better idea of where the student could go if they went with their matched major.
<br><br>
Along with the application, we also thought about how it could be implemented to provide the most benefit for incoming freshman. So, we thought that this application should be used before or during freshman orientation in order to help give the students an idea of majors that fit them the best. If something like this is done, no longer will students have to take random classes to figure out what they should major in, which will save time and, potentially, money. Students will just be taking classes that they know that they need.
<br><br>
This also isn't something that is just beneficul for our IU. This solution could be used at any college. So, the questions will differ between schools since not all schools have the same majors/degrees.</p>

<h4>Project Description</h4>
<p>For my HCI/d class, our task was to design something that will improve public safety. The problem my team and I decided to address was walk safety, especially at night. As college students, we all know the dangers of walking home alone at night. Our goal was to design something that will help anyone walking home at night feel safer and more confident.
<br><br>
We designed a mobile application that we named, SafePath, which gives the user various walking paths to their destination based on the surrounding area's safeness level.
<br><br>
<i>We designed our concept following a modified version of the PRInCiPleS design framework, an organizing framework used in the HCI/d program at IU.</i></p>

<h5>Predispositions</h5>
<p>Most of the time, people feel unsafe while walking at night because they don't know where they are or aren't familiar with the area and/or are walking alone.</p>

<h5>Research</h5>
<p>In order to figure out the features we should include in our app, we interviewed a student at IU to get a better understanding to why people feel unsafe when walking home at night. She told us that she usually felt unsafe when in areas that were dully lit or less populated.</p>

<h5>Insights</h5>
<p>How can we help the user feel safer and more comfortable while walking alone at night?</p>

<h5>Concept</h5>
<p>The main function of SafePath is to provide the user with paths based on the area's safeness. The safety percentages are calculated based on the amount of people that are generally in the area, the amount of crime alerts that have occurred in the area, and the length of time that the path is in the area. While the safest route is always the recommended route, the user has the ability to choose any route they would like, including short but less safe routes. The user also has the option to use the "WalkingBuddy" feature, which is basically, Uber for walking. The app will give the user a list of people that they could walk with based on their destination and the user's gender preference in walking buddy. To ensure the safety of the students who use the application, anyone who wants to use it must enter their university ID to verify that they are students before they are allowed access.</p>
<br><br>
<h5>Modifications</h5>

<div class="col-lg-6">
<img src="../assets/img/portfolio/safepath_4modified.png" class="img-responsive"></div>
</div>
<p>When we showed our design to our interviewee for feedback, she pointed out that while we know that the walking partner is an IU student; there is no guarantee that they will be a "nice" IU student. To fix this potential safety issue, we gave the app the ability to show rating for the Walking Buddies. We based this off of the rating system that Uber uses.</p>
<p>
Our user also pointed out a potential issue with the emergency button. Originally, we thought it would be a good idea to put an emergency button on the lock screen of the phone. This button would alert the police and other people that you were in trouble. But, after thinking it over, we decided that the iPhone and other popular phones have emergency buttons already on the lock screen. We decided to get rid of this because we thought that a button on the lock screen would have too much of a risk of false emergency calls if your finger actually touched the button.</p>

<p>In my HCI/d class, we were asked to interview someone and redesign a device that they no longer use. The goal was to redesign it in a way that would encourage them to use it again. The device our interviewee stopped using was her alarm clock. So, we came up with a redesign of the standard alarm clock that would encourage people, such as our interviewee, to use their alarm clock again.
<br><br>
Our design, the EyeClock, is a small, powerful, and highly customizable alarm clock that works with your mobile phone to get you up and motivated for your day. The small device features a projector mounted on top of a clock. The Bluetooth enabled device works with the EyeClock mobile application on your phone to give you the greatest flexibility in setting your alarm anytime, anywhere.
<br><br>
<i>We designed our concept following a modified version of the PRInCiPleS design framework, an organizing framework used in the HCI/d program at IU.</i></p>
<h5>Predispositions</h5>
<p>Before we interviewed our user, we thought about why users would no long use an alarm clock. People just use their phones for their alarms now instead of an actual alarm clock.</p>

<h5>Research</h5>
<p>We interviewed our user to get an understanding to why she stopped using her alarm clock. And, as we thought, she no longer used her alarm clock because her cell phone can function as her alarm clock. She found it easier to turn off because her cell phone was always right next to her bed. She also mentioned it was easier to set an alarm on her phone and she had more options such as a custom alarm tone and volume control.</p>

<h5>Insights</h5>
<p>How can we make the process of setting and controlling an alarm clock easier and more convenient as well as making it as customizable as possible?</p>

<h5>Concept</h5>
<p>The main part of our design was the mobile application. The application allows the user to easily set and edit an existing alarms with plenty of customization. To initially set it up, all the user would have to do is push the Bluetooth button on the clock to turn on the signal and open the application where they would then input the clock’s serial number to allow it to connect. Having this application makes setting up a alarm much more convenient. The application also allows users to set up multiple alarms for different days and times, which is something her old alarm clock could not do. Along with setting alarms, the other main feature of the EyeClock is that, when the alarm goes off, the alarm clock will project an image onto the ceiling or wherever the projector is pointing at of the time, date, weather forecast, and a list of events the user had planned for the day. Whether these things appear or not can be determined in the application when setting or editing an alarm. The application will then pull the user's events from the calendar on her phone as well as the weather.</p>

<p>At my university, I was part of the Fitness and Wellness Living-Learning Community. The community was for students who like to live a healthy lifestyle. I was also a member of the Board of Directors, which was the committee that planned all the events for the FWLLC.
<br><br>
Every year, the board made t-shirts for the community. But, one year, we didn't have a design. So, I volunteered to make one. It took me a few sketches to get a design I liked. In the end, I went with like a "vintage" kind of look with a classic banner and a slightly distressed effect.</p>
