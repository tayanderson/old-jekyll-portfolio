  <h5 id="beginning-stages">Beginning Stages</h5>
<p>This was more of a personal project that I wanted to do to help me learn a bit of Android Development. I wanted to focus this project on something I like to do: cooking. For me, and others as well, sometimes I open my fridge and think, “I don’t have any food.” Of course, in reality, I do have stuff but I just don’t know what to do with it sometimes. So, that’s where I came up with this idea.</p>

<p>The app will find recipes based on the ingredients in your fridge as well as the type of meal you want to make (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner) or allergies/dietary restrictions you might have (No nuts, Low-Carb, Vegetarian, etc.).</p>

<p>Once I had an idea of what features I wanted to implement, I started sketching. Originally, I wanted each ingredient to appear in a “removable box” underneath the search bar so that the user could a) easily see what things they have inputed and b) to make it easy for them to remove them.</p>

<h5 id="development">Development</h5>
<p>After the planning stage of the project, I jumped into the code. Before this, I had bascially no Android Development skills. But, I did have some experience with development and programming, which was helpful. So, once I started coding, I realized I may have taken on a little more than I could chew. I had no idea how I was actually going to implement the features I wanted to include in my app. So, I started researching. A lot. Most of my time was actually spent learning how to implement certain features and components in Android Studio. Because of how much trouble I was having with it all, I had to change my original design slightly. I had to scratch the “ingredient box” idea and opt for just a filterable search function.</p>

<h5 id="prototype">Prototype</h5>
<p>After hours of no sleep and staring at my computer screen, I was able to develop an app that was pretty close to the one I had originally designed. The user could find recipes by ingredient, type of meal and/or allergies/dietary restrictions. As the user inputs ingredients, meal types or allergy/dietary restrictions their recipe results will show up below. When the user taps on a recipe, they will be taken to the recipe page where they can see a brief description of the dish, the steps to prepare it and the nutritional information. The user can also adjust the recipe depending on how many people they are cooking for. The app keeps track of the recipes that user looks at, just in cause they want to quickly go back to a past recipe. If a user knows of a recipe that is not already in the database, they will have the ability to add it.</p>
