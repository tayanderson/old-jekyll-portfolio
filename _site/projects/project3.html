<p>My client needed a complete overhaul of their website. So, my goal was to create a new website for them that would improve their web presence as well as appeal to new and old clients. I faced a few challenges trying to accomplish this goal. One was coming up with an appealing and user friendly design that could be content heavy. My client had a significant amount of content that they wanted to be displayed on the site so the site design needed to be able to handle that. I solved this by utilizing tabs. I didn’t want the user to be thrown too much information at one time so my solution was to hide some of that information until the user decided that they wished to learn more about a specific service.</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/project-imgs/project9/sda-screenshot2" class="indiv-proj-img" /></p>

<p>I used Wordpress for this project because my client wanted the ability to edit their own content as well as have a blog. So, I thought Wordpress would be a good solution for this.</p>
