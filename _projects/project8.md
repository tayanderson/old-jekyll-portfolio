title: Aftermath

description: This was inspired by post-apocalypse movies. With this image, I was trying to tell the story of an aftermath of an attack on a major city such as New York. A woman, who had managed to live by jumping in a sewer, comes out when it is all over only to see that the city where she lived was completely destroyed and she was the sole survivor. To tell this story, I had to make the destruction of the city in the image look realistic.
