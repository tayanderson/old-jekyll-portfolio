##### Predispositions
Most students don't really know what they want to do or be in the future when they enter college, which makes it difficult to choose a major.

##### Research
For us to get a better understanding of our problem space, we conducted a few interviews with people from our target user group, which were mostly freshman and sophomore students at IU. We asked them about their overall experience so far with choosing a major. Like most students in college, our interviewees had changed majors several times after coming to college. They told us that you really don't know what you want to do until you take a few classes in that area. But, no one has the time (or the money) to take all the introduction and core classes of majors you are interested in. If you don't want to be in school forever, you eventually have to choose fairly quickly. Our interviewees said that they thought it would really be nice if there was a way to improve/change this process.

##### Insights
How could we make the process of choosing a major easier and less stressful, especially for 1st year students?

##### Concept
For our solution, we designed an experience that could change the way incoming freshman or any college student choose a major. The student answers a set of carefully selected questions then, based on their results, and the application will provide the student with a major/degree that fits them as best as possible. Along with the student's matched major, the application will also provide descriptions on courses that required for the major as well as sample schedules and interviews from students who have majored in the student's matched major. Although, we didn't include it in our design, we also thought that the application should also provide successful alumni who earned degrees in that field to get a better idea of the career opportunities for their matched major.

Along with the application, we also thought about how it could be implemented to provide the most benefit for incoming freshman. So, we thought that this application should be used before or during freshman orientation in order to give the students an idea of majors that will fit them the best before they enroll in any classes. If something like this is done, no longer will students have to take random classes to figure out what they should major in, which will save time and, potentially, money. Students will just be taking classes that they know that they need and know they are interested in.

This isn't something that is just beneficial for IU. This solution could be used at any college. The questions will differ between schools since not all schools have the same majors/degrees.
