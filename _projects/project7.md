description: This piece shows the skill progression of a snowboarder. I was inspired by my own snowboarding experiences. I got the inspiration to add the light/brush effects to my project from artist and designer Chuck Anderson. Chuck Anderson is known for including glowing light type effects in his work. I used the light effects as an intresting way to visualize the skill progression. For example, the first image is showing his beginner stage so the effects looked a little messy to symbolize that. While, the effects in his expert stage look more clean.
