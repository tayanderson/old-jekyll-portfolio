##### Predispositions
People just use their phones for their alarms now instead of an actual alarm clock.

Alarm Clocks can be a hassle and don't offer many customizable options.

##### Research
We interviewed our user to get an understanding to why she stopped using her alarm clock. And, as we thought, she no longer used her alarm clock because her cell phone can function as her alarm clock. She found it easier to turn off because her cell phone was always right next to her bed. She also mentioned it was easier to set an alarm on her phone and she had more options such as a custom alarm tone and volume control.

##### Insights
**Customizable** - People want an alarm clock that is highly customizable (custom alarm tone, volume control, multiple alarms for different days)

**Ease of Use and Convenience** - The process of setting and controlling an alarm clock needs to be easy to use and convenient

##### Concept
The main part of our design was the mobile application. The application allows the user to easily set and edit an existing alarms with plenty of customization, remotely. They have the option of setting and controlling their alarm clock on the clock itself but all of that can also be done on their smartphones. To initially set it up, all the user would have to do is push the Bluetooth button on the clock to turn on the signal and open the application where they would then input the clockâ€™s serial number to allow it to connect. Having this application makes setting up a alarm much more convenient. The application also allows users to set up multiple alarms for different days and times, which is something our interviewee told us that her old alarm clock could not do. 

Along with setting alarms, the other main feature of the SmartClock is that, when the alarm goes off, the alarm clock will project an image onto the ceiling or wherever the projector is pointing at of the time, date, weather forecast, and a list of events the user had planned for the day. Whether these things appear or not can be determined in the application when setting or editing an alarm. The application will then pull the user's events from the calendar on her phone as well as the weather.
