			<p>Hey, my names is Taylor. I'm a designer and developer from Chicago.</p>

			<p>I like to create meaningful and innovative experiences/interactions in the digital space. My past work mostly consists of User Experience, Graphic Design, Front-End Development and some Digitial Marketing. I take a human-centered approach to all my work because understanding people and how they think is what fascinates me, especially in the context of technology. I believe technology can be utilized in any industry and I want use my technical and creative knowledge to help connect people in some way and, ultimately, make a difference.</p>

			<p>Other than that, I love to go snowboarding, eat dope food (I am a serious foodie), workout, drink craft cocktails and binge watch trash TV shows.</p>

			<h5>Let's Chat</h5>
			<p>If you want to get in contact with me or would like a copy of my resume, you can reach me by email: <strong>andersstaylor@gmail.com</strong></p>
