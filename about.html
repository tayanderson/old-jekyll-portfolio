			Hey, I'm Taylor.</p>
			I'm a designer/ developer/ taco enthusiast that likes to create meaningful and innovative experiences/interactions in the digital space. I've done some User Experience, Digital and Print Design work as well as some in Front-End Development projects. I also tried to build a robot once with Raspberry Pi, so there's that too.</p>

			<p>When I'm not in front of my computer, I like to go snowboarding (even though I've literally only been on like 2 trips ever), eat tacos (Love me a good al pastor taco), go bouldering, drink craft cocktails and binge watch trash TV shows.</p>

			<h5>Let's Talk</h5>
			<p>If you want to get in contact with me about anything, really, you can reach me by email: <strong>andersstaylor@gmail.com</strong></p>
			<p>You can view my resume <strong><a href="assets/files/TaylorAnderson---Resume.pdf">here</strong></a>.</p>
