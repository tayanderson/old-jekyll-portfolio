			<p>Hey, I'm Taylor.</p>
			<p>I design, develop, take pictures and eat tacos.</p>

			<p>I like to create meaningful and innovative experiences/interactions. My experiences consists of User Experience, Graphic Design, Front-End Development and Digtial Marketing.</p>

			<p>I also enjoy photography. I mainly photograph food. I love everything about food and dining - the food, the process and the people who make it. My interest in food photography started when I got my first apartment in college. After being stuck in the dorms for two years, I finally had access to a real kitchen. I cooked hella food, began posting my creations on Instagram and found an interest in capturing food and food experiences.</p>

			<p>Other than that, I like to go snowboarding, eat food, go bouldering, drink craft cocktails and binge watch trash TV shows.</p>
