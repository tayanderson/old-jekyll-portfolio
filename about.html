			I'm a problem solver. Lately, I've been solving problems in using design and development to create meaningful and innovative experiences/interactions in the digital space. I like to take a human-centered approach to all my work because understanding people and how they think is what fascinates me.</p>

			<p>I love to snowboard, eat tacos, go indoor climbing, drink craft cocktails and binge watch trash TV shows.</p>
