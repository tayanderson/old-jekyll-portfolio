			<p>Hey, my names is Taylor. I design, develop, take pictures and eat tacos.</p>

			<p>I like to create meaningful and innovative experiences/interactions in the digital space. My past work mostly consists of User Experience, Graphic Design, Front-End Development and Digitial Marketing. I take a human-centered approach to all my work because understanding people and how they think is what fascinates me, especially in the context of technology. I believe technology can be utilized in any industry and I want use my technical and creative knowledge to help connect people in some way and, ultimately, make a difference in this world.</p>

			<p>I also enjoy photography, mainly food photography. I love everything about food and dining - the food, the process and the people who make it. I love to learn about and experience all of it.</p>

			<p>Other than that, I love to go snowboarding, eat dope food, workout, drink craft cocktails and binge watch trash TV shows.</p>
