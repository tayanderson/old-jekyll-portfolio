			<p>I enjoy solving complex problems using design and development to create meaningful and innovative experiences and interactions in the digital and physical spaces. I take a human-centered approach to all my work because understanding people and how they think is what fascinates me, especially in the context of technology.</p>

			<h5>Fun Facts</h5>
			<p>I <b>love</b> to snowboard, which is kind of an odd thing considering I live nowhere near any mountains. Other things I enjoy are tacos, indoor climbing, craft cocktails and binge watching trash TV shows.</p>
			<h5>Let's Talk</h5>
			<p>If you want to get in contact with me about anything, really, you can reach me by email: <strong>andersstaylor@gmail.com</strong></p>
