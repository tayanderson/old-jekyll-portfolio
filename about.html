			<p>I enjoy solving complex problems using design and development to create meaningful and innovative experiences and interactions in the digital space. I take a human-centered approach to all my work because understanding people and how they think is what fascinates me, especially in the context of technology. I want to, ultimately, use design and technology to make a difference somehow in the world.</p>

			<p>I consider myself to be both a designer and developer, because I have skills in both. I can create wireframes and prototypes or build entire websites and web/mobile apps. I can be your UX or IxD Designer or your Front-End Dev...or a bit of both. From a designer perspective, I feel that it is important for any designer to not only understand development but to also have some experience doing it in order to understand the technical feasibility of solutions.</p>
