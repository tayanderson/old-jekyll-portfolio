			<p>I enjoy solving complex problems using design and development to create meaningful and innovative experiences and interactions in the digital space. I take a human-centered approach to all my work because understanding people and how they think is what fascinates me, especially in the context of technology. I want to, ultimately, use design and technology to make a difference somehow in the world.</p>

			<p>I consider myself to be a developer with design skills. I started off as more of a programmer then transitioned to more of a Front-End Developer, incorporating design into my work. Design and Development are like puzzles to me. Design allows me to think critically about everyday problems and come up with innovative solutions. And Development allows me to think about how I can make those solutions a reality.</p>

			<h5>Fun Facts</h5>
			<p>I <b>love</b> to snowboard. I'm not great, though. I had to get saved from Ski Patrol on my recent trip out West but I still love it. Other things I enjoy are tacos, indoor climbing, craft cocktails and binge watching trash TV shows.</p>
