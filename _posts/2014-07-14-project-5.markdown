  <h4>Project Description</h4>
  <p>At my university, I was part of the Fitness and Wellness Living-Learning Community. The community was for students who like to live a healthy lifestyle. I was also a member of the Board of Directors, which was the committee that planned all the events for the FWLLC.
  <br><br>
  Every year, the board made t-shirts for the community. But, one year, we didn't have a design. So, I volunteered to make one. It took me a few sketches to get a design I liked. In the end, I went with like a "vintage" kind of look with a classic banner and a slightly distressed effect.</p>
