  <p>"MyFridgeRecipes" is a mobile application that helps home cooks, especially those who don’t know a lot about cooking, find recipes according to what ingredients they have on hand.</p>
  
  <h5>Beginning Stages</h5>
  <p>When I first came up with the idea for this application, there were alot of features I wanted to include. Not only did I want the app to find recipes by ingredient, but also by type of meal (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner) or allergies/dietary restrictions (No nuts, Low-Carb, Vegetarian). If the user has an is allergic to nut, for example, they could choose to only see recipes that do not have nuts. And, to make the process as simple as possible, I also wanted the app to remember that the user has a nut allergy so they don’t have to input it every time. However, if the user was just cooking for someone who has a nut allergy (meaning they won’t be cooking like that all the time), they could choose to just temporary filter out the recipes with nuts. 
  </p>
  <p>Once I had an idea of what features I wanted to implement, I started sketching. Originally, I wanted the ingredient to appear in a removeable box underneath the search so that the user could a) easily see what things they have inputed and b) to make it easy for them to remove them.</p>
  
  <h5>Coding</h5>
  <p>After the planning stage of the project, I jumped into the code. Before this, I had bascially no Android Development skills. I learned a little Java back in the day but that was about it. So, once I started coding, I realized I may have taken on a little more than I could chew. I had no idea how I was actually going to implement the features I wanted to include in my app. So, I started researching. A lot. Most of my time was spent learning and practicing how to implement certain features and components in Android Studio. Because of how much trouble I was having with it all, I had to change my original design slightly. So, I had to scratch the "ingredient box" idea. I just could not find a way to make it work.
  </p>
  <h5>User Testing</h5>
  <p>
  Once my app had its main functions and looked decent enough to show to other people, I did a little user testing. My user was able to point out some bugs for me as well as add some input about what she thought about the app. Overall, she thought it was a cool idea. One of the things she thought would improve it was to somehow intergrate it with social media. Such as, sharing images of recipes you made on Instagram or sharing a recipe on Facebook. As cool as those ideas were, I unfortunatly was unable to include them in the final version of the app because of time contraints.
  </p>
  <h5>Final Version</h5>
  <p>After hours of no sleep and staring at my computer screen, I was able to develop an app that was pretty close to the one I had originally designed. In the final version, along with being able to find recipes by ingredient, the user could also filter the results by type of meal or allergies/dietary restrictions. As the user inputs ingredients, meal types or allergy/dietary restrictions their recipe results will show up below. When the user taps on a recipe, they will be taken to the recipe page where they can see a brief description of the dish, the steps to prepare it and the nutritional information. The user can also adjust the recipe depending on how many people they are cooking for. The app keeps track of the recipes that user looks at, just in cause they want to quickly go back to a past recipe. If a user knows of a recipe that is not already in the database, they will have the ability to add it. </p>
  <h5>Thoughts</h5>
  <p>This was by far the hardest project I have worked on so far. I had to learn a lot about Android Development in a very short amount of time so that was a little hard for me to deal with. In the end, I am very proud (and somwhat surprised) that I was able to develop this. One thing I learned: Android is hard!</p>
