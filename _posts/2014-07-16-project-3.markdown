  <h4>Project Description</h4>
  <p>In my HCI/d class, we designed a tablet application that could be used to help college students, mainly incoming freshman, pick a major based on a set of carefully selected questions, which depend on the college or university.
  <br><br>
  <i>We designed our concept following a modified version of the PRInCiPleS design framework, an organizing framework used in the HCI/d program at IU.</i></p>

  <h5>Predispositions</h5>
  <p>Most students don't really know what they want to do or be in the future when they enter college, which makes it difficult to choose a major.</p>

  <h5>Research</h5>
  <p>Since my team and I had all been freshman at some point, we all experienced the struggle of choosing a major during our freshman/sophomore years. But, we also wanted to get an oppinon from a student who was currently a freshman at the time. So, we interviewed a 1st year student who agreed that figuring out what he wanted to major was a difficult task when he first entered college. It also made it hard to choose classes for his first semester since he didn't really know what he wanted to do. Now, after taking a few classes, he had a better idea of what he liked and disliked which would make it easier for him to narrow down his options when deciding on a major. But, he felt like it would be much easier and less stressful if there was somehow a way to help him decide on a major before he enrolled in any classes.</p>

  <h5>Insights</h5>
  <p>How could we make the process of choosing a major easier and less stressful,  especially for 1st year students?</p>

  <h5>Concept</h5>
  <p>For our solution, we designed an experience that could change the way incoming freshman or any college student choose a major. The way the application worked was as follows: the student answers a set of carefully selected questions then, based on their results, the application will provide the student with a major/degree that fit them as best as possible. Along with the student's matched major, the application will also provide descriptions on courses that required for the major as well as sample schdeules and interviews from students who have majored in the student's matched major. Although, we didn't include it in our design, we also thought that the application should also provide successful alumni who earned degrees in that field to get a better idea of where the student could go if they went with their matched major.
  <br><br>
  Along with the application, we also thought about how it could be implemented to provide the most benefit for incoming freshman. So, we thought that this application should be used before or during freshman orientation in order to help give the students an idea of majors that fit them the best. If something like this is done, no longer will students have to take random classes to figure out what they should major in, which will save time and, potentially, money. Students will just be taking classes that they know that they need.
  <br><br>
  This also isn't something that is just beneficul for our IU. This solution could be used at any college. So, the questions will differ between schools since not all schools have the same majors/degrees.</p>
