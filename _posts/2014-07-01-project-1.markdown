  <p>In my HCI/d class, we were asked to interview someone and redesign a device that they no longer use. The goal was to redesign it in a way that would encourage them to use it again. The device our interviewee stopped using was her alarm clock. So, we came up with a redesign of the standard alarm clock that would encourage people, such as our interviewee, to use their alarm clock again.
  <br><br>
  Our design, the EyeClock, is a small, powerful, and highly customizable alarm clock that works with your mobile phone to get you up and motivated for your day. The small device features a projector mounted on top of a clock. The Bluetooth enabled device works with the EyeClock mobile application on your phone to give you the greatest flexibility in setting your alarm anytime, anywhere.
  <br><br>
  <i>We designed our concept following a modified version of the PRInCiPleS design framework, an organizing framework used in the HCI/d program at IU.</i></p>
  <h5>Predispositions</h5>
  <p>Before we interviewed our user, we thought about why users would no long use an alarm clock. People just use their phones for their alarms now instead of an actual alarm clock.</p>

  <h5>Research</h5>
  <p>We interviewed our user to get an understanding to why she stopped using her alarm clock. And, as we thought, she no longer used her alarm clock because her cell phone can function as her alarm clock. She found it easier to turn off because her cell phone was always right next to her bed. She also mentioned it was easier to set an alarm on her phone and she had more options such as a custom alarm tone and volume control.</p>

  <h5>Insights</h5>
  <p>How can we make the process of setting and controlling an alarm clock easier and more convenient as well as making it as customizable as possible?</p>

  <h5>Concept</h5>
  <p>The main part of our design was the mobile application. The application allows the user to easily set and edit an existing alarms with plenty of customization. To initially set it up, all the user would have to do is push the Bluetooth button on the clock to turn on the signal and open the application where they would then input the clockâ€™s serial number to allow it to connect. Having this application makes setting up a alarm much more convenient. The application also allows users to set up multiple alarms for different days and times, which is something her old alarm clock could not do. Along with setting alarms, the other main feature of the EyeClock is that, when the alarm goes off, the alarm clock will project an image onto the ceiling or wherever the projector is pointing at of the time, date, weather forecast, and a list of events the user had planned for the day. Whether these things appear or not can be determined in the application when setting or editing an alarm. The application will then pull the user's events from the calendar on her phone as well as the weather.</p>
